<h1>CODING CHALLENGE</h1>
<p>Suppose that you're working in a small town administration, and you're in charge of two town elements:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Parks</li>
    <li>Streets</li>
</ol>
<p>It's a very small town, so right now there are only 3 parks and 4 streets. All parks and streets have a name and a
    build year.
    At an end-of-year meeting, your boss wants a final report with the following:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Tree density of each park in the town (forumla: number of trees/park area)</li>
    <li>Average age of each town's park (forumla: sum of all ages/number of parks)</li>
    <li>The name of the park that has more than 1000 trees</li>
    <li>Total and average length of the town's streets</li>
    <li>Size classification of all streets: tiny/small/normal/big/huge. If the size is unknown, the default is normal
    </li>
</ol>

<p>All the report data should be printed to the console.</p>
